// Type Inference => if we directly assign value to a variable without type, typescript will automatically consider its datatype, and it is different from javascript, because in js even after js has identified datatype still you can assign other types of values and function with the number but in ts not.

// Don't use 'any' data type more often, we can use the complie flag 'noImplicitAny' to flag any implicit 'any' as an error.
